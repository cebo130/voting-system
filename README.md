## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for StuPoll application.

-The University of Kwa Zulu-natal just recently had their SRC elections and I noticed they do not have an app for voting for the SRC.
-They use a web based application which is prone to many errors and security threats.
-creating a voting account on the existing web system was a strugle for students as they had to keep reseting their passwords and even after that some had to be assisted by the officials to get their accounts up and running and ready to vote.
-The User-Interface was very old fashioned, not easy to use(not user friendly), many students ended up voting for the wrong parties by mistake as some images clashed with others.
-These are just the basic problems I noticed and there are more ...
-So, I deceided to create my own App for the voting system that will address all these problems .
- My App allows Users to create account and log in very easily, has smooth user-interface and no room for error such as voting for the wrong party as images and names are there and do not clash.
- The School system's Results take a lot of time to be displayed back to students...
- on My App , Results are shown immidiately after votes are casted... this is so everyone can see how their parties are perfoming and it makes the system trustworthy.
